As one ages, maths on head gets less reliable. 

## How to avoid maths on head: 
- update the input.txt to contain your guitar tabs 
- make sure the format is exactly the same as the sample input tab of the wonderful song [Basanta by JPTRockerz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBhZCx_EUwI&pp=ygUTYmFzYW50YSBqcHQgcm9ja2Vyeg%3D%3D) (the length doesn't matter, but capo number, and the presence of string names and bar dividers (|) matters)
- go run . 
- as long as you haven't aged enough to not see properly, expect something on the stdOut
    - could be a panic, "something" was used with the full awareness of the fact that this code is not production standard
